# dkr2sh - convert Dockerfile to shell script

This script naively translates some Dockerfile instructions into corresponding shell commands.

## Usage
Use dkr2sh.sed, a sed script.

`./dkr2sh.sed < path-to-Dockerfile > mydockerscript.sh`

`<` denotes input file, `>` denotes output file in sed scripts. 

## Conversion Rules

### Instructions commented out

* FROM
* CMD
* LABEL
* MAINTAINER
* EXPOSE
* ENTRYPOINT
* VOLUME
* ARG
* ONBUILD
* STOPSIGNAL
* HEALTHCHECK

Translate these instructions manually:

* USER - execute the next block(s) with `su` or equivalent
* SHELL - unwrap JSON-formatted arguments, run it for subsequent block(s)

### ENV

Before:

    ENV FOO bar

After:

    export FOO=bar

### RUN

Before:

    RUN /usr/bin/foo \
        && /sbin/bar --quux

After:

    /usr/bin/foo \
        && /sbin/bar --quux

### COPY

`COPY` behaves differently on files and directories, so we use `rsync` to emulate *recursive
content copying* on directories.

If `--from` argument is given, it becomes just a comment, because unlike Docker images (and ogres),
shell scripts don't have layers.

Before:

    COPY --from=composer foo.sh /usr/local/bin/

After:

    for i in foo.sh; do
            test -d "$i" && i="$i/"
            rsync -a "$i" /usr/local/bin/ # --from=composer
    done

### WORKDIR

Before:

    WORKDIR /var/lib/pgsql/10.1

After:

    mkdir -p /var/lib/pgsql/10.1 && cd /var/lib/pgsql/10.1

### ADD

`ADD` has [many rules](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/reference/builder/#add), and transforms
into a fairly large snippet.

Before:

    ADD https://example.org/foo.bin /opt

After:

    if echo "/opt" | grep -q '/$'; then
            mkdir -p "/opt";
    else
            mkdir -p "$(dirname "/opt")";
    fi

    for i in https://example.org/foo.bin; do
            if echo "$i" | grep -q '^\(https\?\|ftp\)://'; then
                    if echo "/opt" | grep -q '/$'; then
                            (cd "/opt" && wget -q "$i");
                    else
                            wget -q -O "/opt" "$i";
                    fi
            elif test -d "$i"; then
                    rsync -a "$i/" "/opt";
            elif tar -tf "$i" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
                    mkdir -p "/opt" && tar -C "/opt" -xf "$i";
            else
                    rsync -a "$i" "/opt";
            fi
    done
